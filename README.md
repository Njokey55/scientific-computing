1. datatypes.py
Objective:
This script shows the use of various Python data types (integer, float, complex, list, tuple, dictionary, set, and boolean). It prints the type of each variable using Pythonâ€™s built-in type() function and shows how to convert between int and float.

How to run:
       python datatypes.py
         
What I learned:
This script helped me understand the various built-in data types in Python and how to work with type conversion.

2. control_structures.py
Objective:
This script shows Python's control structures, such as if-else, for loops, and while loops. It checks whether a user-provided number is even or odd, prints even numbers from 1 to 50, and counts down from 10 to 1.

How to run:
       python control_structures.py
           
What I learned:
This script helped me learn how to use conditional statements and loops in Python effectively to solve problems.

3. modular_functions.py
Objective:
This script defines a function calculate_area that calculates the area of different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle). It demonstrates function usage, default arguments, and modularity.

How to run:
       python modular_functions.py
          
What I learned:
I learned how to define functions, use default parameters, and make the code modular to reuse the calculate_area function for different shapes.

What I learned from this exercise:
Through this exercise, I gained a better understanding of basic Python concepts, such as:

Data Types: I learned about the various built-in data types like integers, floats, complex numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and booleans. I also explored how to convert between types.

Control Structures: I understood how to use conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for and while) for decision-making and iteration.

Functions & Modularity: I learned the importance of modular programming by creating reusable functions and how to structure a program in a way that improves readability and maintainability.
